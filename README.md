# Hi, my name is Rich Acosta
Developer, engineer, cloud architect, and many other things in between.

I can probably fix your computer but I'd much rather be working on enabling enterprises to transform
their technology operations to get the most value from The Cloud. Retro computing and game enthusiast.

Central Jersey does exist; I live there.
