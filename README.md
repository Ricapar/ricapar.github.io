# Hi, my name is Rich Acosta
Developer, engineer, cloud architect, and many other things in between. Retro computing and game enthusiast.

I can probably fix your computer but I'd much rather be working on enabling enterprises to transform
their technology operations to get the most value from the cloud.

Central Jersey does exist; I live there.
